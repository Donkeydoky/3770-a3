This is for 3770 assignment3.

So far I have create four c# scripts: a 'character' base class for both 'boss' and 'characterPriest' and a 'controller' for controlling the main game logic.

'character' is responsible constructing the basic attributes for a character in this game, such as properties health and damage with corresponding methods.

While 'boss' and 'characterPriest' inheritenced here this class, and and more unique properties to its own with suitable methods.

The controller is also the containner of the game, it runs the game logically, record the data generated along with the game progressing, and finnaly output the data into a cvs file inside the project hierarchy as reqiured by the assignments.
